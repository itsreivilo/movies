1939,"The inaugural Cannes Film Festival was to have been held in 1939, but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The festival was not inaugurated until after the conclusion of the war.[14] Sixty-three years later, the organizers of the 2002 festival assembled a jury of six members, including Dieter Kosslick and Alberto Barbera, to watch seven of the twelve features which had been entered into the 1939 competition, namely: Goodbye, Mr. Chips, La Loi du Nord, Lenin in 1918, The Four Feathers, The Wizard of Oz, Union Pacific, and Boefje. Union Pacific by Cecil B. DeMille was retrospectively voted the winner of the 1939 Palme d'Or.","The inaugural Cannes Film Festival was to have been held in 1939, but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the Second World War.
